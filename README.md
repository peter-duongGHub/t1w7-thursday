# Advanced Data Types

## Lists (familiar face)
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, replace, remove) collections of items. indexing [0]
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cheery", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (unchageable, cannot add, replace or remove) collections of items
- They are defined by enclosing elements in parenthesis/ small brackets ().

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements) 
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference. 
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if elements exists in the set. 
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.
